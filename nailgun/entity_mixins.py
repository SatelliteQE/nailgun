    This class is rather useless as is, and it is intended to be subclassed.
    Subclasses can specify two useful types of information:

    * fields
    * metadata

    Fields and metadata are represented by the ``_fields`` and ``_meta``
    instance attributes, respectively. Here is an example of how to define and
    instantiate an entity:

    >>> class User(Entity):
    ...     def __init__(self, server_config=None, **kwargs):
    ...         self._fields = {
    ...             'name': StringField(),
    ...             'supervisor': OneToOneField('User'),
    ...             'subordinate': OneToManyField('User'),
    ...         }
    ...         self._meta = {'api_path': 'api/users'}
    ...         return super(User, self).__init__(server_config, **kwargs)
    ...
    >>> user = User(
    ...     name='Alice',
    ...     supervisor=User(id=1),
    ...     subordinate=[User(id=3), User(id=4)],
    ... )
    >>> user.name == 'Alice'
    True
    >>> user.supervisor.id = 1
    True

    The canonical procedure for initializing foreign key fields, shown above,
    is powerful but verbose. It is tiresome to write statements such as
    ``[User(id=3), User(id=4)]``. As a convenience, entity IDs may be given:

    >>> User(name='Alice', supervisor=1, subordinate=[3, 4])
    >>> user.name == 'Alice'
    True
    >>> user.supervisor.id = 1
    True

    An entity object is useless if you are unable to use it to communicate with
    a server. The solution is to provide a :class:`nailgun.config.ServerConfig`
    when instantiating a new entity.

    1. If the ``server_config`` argument is specified, then that is used.
    2. Otherwise, if :data:`nailgun.entity_mixins.DEFAULT_SERVER_CONFIG` is
       set, then that is used.
    3. Otherwise, call :meth:`nailgun.config.ServerConfig.get`.

    An entity's server configuration is stored as a private instance variaable
    and is used by mixin methods, such as
    :meth:`nailgun.entity_mixins.Entity.path`. For more information on server
    configuration objects, see :class:`nailgun.config.BaseServerConfig`.

    :raises nailgun.entity_mixins.NoSuchFieldError: If a value is assigned to a
        non-existent field.
    :raises nailgun.entity_mixins.BadValueError: If an inappropriate value is

        Make an HTTP GET request to the server, including the payload.

    """

    def search_payload(self, fields=None, query=None):
        """Create a search query.

        Do the following:

        1. Generate a search query. By default, all values returned by
           :meth:`nailgun.entity_mixins.Entity.get_values` are used. If
           ``fields`` is specified, only the named values are used.
        2. Merge ``query`` in to the generated search query.
        3. Return the result.

        The rules for generating a search query can be illustrated by example.
        Let's say that we have an entity with an
        :class:`nailgun.entity_fields.IntegerField`, a
        :class:`nailgun.entity_fields.OneToOneField` and a
        :class:`nailgun.entity_fields.OneToManyField`::

            >>> some_entity = SomeEntity(id=1, one=2, many=[3, 4])
            >>> fields = some_entity.get_fields()
            >>> isinstance(fields['id'], IntegerField)
            True
            >>> isinstance(fields['one'], OneToOneField)
            True
            >>> isinstance(fields['many'], OneToManyField)
            True

        This method appends "_id" and "_ids" on to the names of each
        ``OneToOneField`` and ``OneToManyField``, respectively::

            >>> some_entity.search_payload()
            {'id': 1, 'one_id': 2, 'many_ids': [3, 4]}

        By default, all fields are used. But you can specify a set of field
        names to use::

            >>> some_entity.search_payload({'id'})
            {'id': 1}
            >>> some_entity.search_payload({'one'})
            {'one_id': 2}
            >>> some_entity.search_payload({'id', 'one'})
            {'id': 1, 'one_id': 2}

        If a ``query`` is specified, it is merged in to the generated query::

            >>> some_entity.search_payload(query={'id': 5})
            {'id': 5, 'one_id': 2, 'many_ids': [3, 4]}
            >>> some_entity.search_payload(query={'per_page': 1000})
            {'id': 1, 'one_id': 2, 'many_ids': [3, 4], 'per_page': 1000}

            query that will be wrong in many cases. In addition, Satellite
            currently accepts invalid search queries without complaint. Make
            sure to check the API documentation for your version of Satellite
            against what this method produces.

    def search(self, fields=None, query=None, filters=None):
        """Search for entities.

        At its simplest, this method searches for all entities of a given kind.
        For example, to ask for all
        :class:`nailgun.entities.LifecycleEnvironment` entities::

            LifecycleEnvironment().search()

        Values on an entity are used to generate a search query, and the
        ``fields`` argument can be used to specify which fields should be used
        when generating a search query::

            lc_env = LifecycleEnvironment(name='foo', organization=1)
            results = lc_env.search()  # Search by name and organization.
            results = lc_env.search({'name', 'organization'})  # Same.
            results = lc_env.search({'name'})  # Search by name.
            results = lc_env.search({'organization'})  # Search by organization
            results = lc_env.search(set())  # Search for all lifecycle envs.
            results = lc_env.search({'library'})  # Error!

        In some cases, the simple search queries that can be generated by
        NailGun are not sufficient. In this case, you can pass in a raw search
        query instead. For example, to search for all lifecycle environments
        with a name of 'foo'::

            LifecycleEnvironment().search(query={'search': 'name="foo"'})

        The example above is rather pointless: it is easier and more concise to
        use a generated query. But — and this is a **very** important "but" —
        the manual search query is melded in to the generated query. This can
        be used to great effect::

            LifecycleEnvironment(name='foo').search(query={'per_page': 50})

        For examples of what the final search queries look like, see
        :meth:`search_payload`. (That method also accepts the ``fields`` and
        ``query`` arguments.)

        In some cases, the server's search facilities may be insufficient, or
        it may be inordinately difficult to craft a search query. In this case,
        you can filter search results locally. For example, to ask the server
        for a list of all lifecycle environments and then locally search
        through the results for the lifecycle environment named "foo"::

            LifecycleEnvironment().search(filters={'name': 'foo'})

        Be warned that filtering locally can be **very** slow. NailGun must
        ``read()`` every single entity returned by the server before filtering
        results. This is because the values used in the filtering process may
        not have been returned by the server in the initial response to the
        search.

        The fact that all entities are read when ``filters`` is specified can
        be used to great effect. For example, this search returns a fully
        populated list of every single lifecycle environment::

            LifecycleEnvironment().search(filters={})

        :param fields: A set naming which fields should be used when generating
            a search query. If ``None``, all values on the entity are used. If
            an empty set, no values are used.
        :param query: A dict containing a raw search query. This is melded in
            to the generated search query like so:  ``{generated:
            query}.update({manual: query})``.
        :param filters: A dict. Used to filter search results locally.
