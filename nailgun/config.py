        The entity classes rely on the requests library to be a transport

        ``post``, accept an ``auth`` argument. That argument must be a tuple:

            Auth tuple to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.

        However, the JSON decoder does not recognize a tuple as a type, and
        represents sequences of elements as a tuple. Compensate for that by
        converting ``auth`` to a two element tuple if it is a two element list.

        This override is done here, and not in the base class, because the base
        class may be extracted out into a separate library and used in other
        contexts. In those contexts, the presence of a list may not matter or
